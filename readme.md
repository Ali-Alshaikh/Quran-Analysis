## Open-Source Contributions

We encourage you to contribute to this project! Please ensure that your contributions are clean, precise, and represent the Holy Quran in the best possible manner.

Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Improve NLP Approaches:** Implement better models like Word2Vec or other advanced techniques.
- **Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs):** Explore how LLMs can help extract deeper insights from various Tafsir books or improve the analysis of the Quranic text.
- **Add More Resources:** Feel free to add work from or inspired by projects like [QURAN-NLP](https://github.com/islamAndAi/QURAN-NLP?tab=readme-ov-file), which has been a major inspiration.

We deeply appreciate any and all contributions that aim to enrich the understanding of the Holy Quran.
